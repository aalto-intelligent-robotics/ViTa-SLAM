1. Settings regarding the view templates
These set the size of the view template:
- image_crop_x_max : defines at which maximum x value the camera input image is cut (in preprocessing)
- image_crop_y_max : defines at which maximum y value the camera input image is cut (in preprocessing) 
- image_crop_x_min and y_min : same for min x/y values

These set parameters related to the matching of two tempaltes
- vt_match_threshold : Sets the maximum difference of two visual templates for which they are considered the same
- tt_template_size : The size of the tactile template, for the whiskeye robot this is 24 whiskers + 27 bins of the point feature histogram (3x3x3)
- tt_match_threshold : Sets the maximum difference of two tactile templates

2. Settings regarding the Posecell Network
- pc_dim_xyz : XYZ dimensions size of the posecells grid
- pc_dim_abg : ABG dimensions size of the posecells grid (alpha, beta, gamma = roll around x, pitch around y, yaw around z)
The following four settings are used to change the size of the activation "cloud" in the posecells grid and how strong it peaks at the center
- pc_w_e_dim : The size of the PDF used to excite the posecells array
- pc_w_i_dim : The size of the PDF used inhibit the posecells array
- pc_w_e_var : The variance of the PDF used to excite
- pc_w_i_var : The variance of the PDF used to inhibit
- pc_global_inhib : In the global inhibition step (after local inhibition) all cells with less than this energy will be set to zero and this value is subtracted from all cells
- pc_vt_inject_energy : The energy that is injected at a place in the posecells grid when a template match was found
- pc_cell_x_size : Sets the size of one unit in pc_dim_xyz, can be used to scale the size of the path that the activation "cloud" takes in the posecells array


3. Settings regarding the Experience map
exp_initial_degree : Rotate the experience map

enable_experience_map : Draw the experience map
exp_map_size : Width and height of the em window
media_path : Path to the image file of the robot and the posecell particles
