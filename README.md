# Whiskeye Robot
This repository contains the plugin and model of the whiskeye_robot platform.

The code and model are provided by Martin Pearson (martin.pearson@brl.ac.uk).

## Usage
The compiled library libwhiskeye_gazebo.cpp and the whiskeye_robot.sdf can be regenerated by running make in the src forlder. They should work out of the box though.

In the test directory there are various sub-folders allowing the state of the build to be tested.

More detailed notes can be found inside the folders.

## Notes
We fixed a bug where one of the links link_pose_x, link_pose_y and link\_pose\_z crahsed the gazebo simulation or were only able to move on the x axis which lead to invisible forces acting on the robot.
